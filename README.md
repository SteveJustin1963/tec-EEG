### Total Recall 1990
Rekall, a company who can implant false memories of everything from exotic trips to sexual encounters ....warnings of previous Rekall customers ending up as lobotomised husks ....a high-tech chair to enjoy his Martian holiday.....memory implant process...dislodges ...repressed history bubbles back to the surface...his entire life is a false memory implanted ....discovers his true identity as an agent

### Fringe tv series
s1e1-pilot, features two people merging their brains together using a special interface. This is based on neural plasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and change in response to new experiences. When two people merge their brains together, they are essentially creating a new learning experience for each other. This is done by spiking each other in the neck, which allows the two brains to merge together.

### Back-to-the-Future-part I

Marty is trying to explain to Doc that he is from the future and needs his help to get back to the year 1985. However, Doc is not interested in listening to him and instead tries to read his thoughts using some kind of advanced technology that allows him to read thoughts. "Marty: Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Doc: My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all."

(https://neuralink.com/), ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers, using implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs). Their "neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh with a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function and facilitating direct computing capabilities from thought. It is inserted through the skull using a tiny needle containing the rolled-up mesh which unravels spanning the brain." 


### My project

My way will not be intrusive, just use a low cost electrode cap. 

eg https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-eeg-electrocap


![](https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-LACE/blob/master/pics/cap2.png)

- The OpenBCI EEG Electrode Cap uses reliable wet electrodes. 
- The product comes in two variants:
  - 21-channel electrode cap with removable, Ag/AgCl coated electrodes
  - Premium 21-channel electrode cap with patented, sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes
- Note, electrode gel and touchproof adapter must be purchased.

Product Features: 
- Sleek, compact design for wet electrode EEG measurements
- Compatibility with all OpenBCI boards and standard touch-proof connectors
- Compatibility with OpenBCI's FREE open-source software https://www.opensourceimaging.org/project/openbci/
- Compatibility with most bioamplifiers vendors eg,
1. TI
2. Analog Devices
3. Maxim Integrated
4. NXP
5. STMicroelectronics
- DIY low cost bioamplifiers using inexpensive op-amps, https://www.electrical4u.com/biological-amplifiers/

- Electrodes located and labeled using the internationally recognized 10-20 system
- Comes in two Ag-AgCl electrode variants, coated and sintered
- The leads terminate in industry-standard 1.5mm Touch-Proof connectors and can be connected to the Cyton 8-channel or CytonDaisy 16-channel board with an electrode adapter

cheaper versions...

### The Joe Rogan Experience
"This was totaly lit and realy cool. We ran some test and got some realy interesting results on the computer when we tested the tec-LACE, an electroencephalography device as worn on the outside of your nut. We found that as you smoke some realy good weed and saying out loud the following, Good-shit, Weed, Pot, Reefer, Grass, Dope, Ganja, Mary Jane, Hash, Herb, Aunt Mary, Skunk, Boom, Chronic, Cheeba, Blunt, Ashes, Atshitshi, Baby Bhang, Bammy, Blanket, Bo-Bo, Bobo Bush, Bomber, Boom, Broccoli, Cripple, Dagga, Dinkie, Dow, Ding, Dona, Juana, Juanita, Flower, Flower Tops, Ganja, Gasper, Giggle Smoke, Good Giggles, Good Butt, Hot Stick, Jay Jolly Green, Joy Smoke, Joy Stick and so on, it peeks the signals on the tec1 and the participant is more relaxed." No shit.
