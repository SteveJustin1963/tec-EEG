### My project

My way will not be intrusive, just use a low cost electrode cap. 

eg https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-eeg-electrocap

- The OpenBCI EEG Electrode Cap uses reliable wet electrodes. 
- The product comes in two variants:
  - 21-channel electrode cap with removable, Ag/AgCl coated electrodes
  - Premium 21-channel electrode cap with patented, sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes
- Note, electrode gel and touchproof adapter must be purchased.

Product Features: 
- Sleek, compact design for wet electrode EEG measurements
- Compatibility with all OpenBCI boards and standard touch-proof connectors
- Compatibility with OpenBCI's FREE open-source software https://www.opensourceimaging.org/project/openbci/
- Compatibility with most bioamplifiers vendors eg,
1. TI
2. Analog Devices
3. Maxim Integrated
4. NXP
5. STMicroelectronics
- DIY low cost bioamplifiers using inexpensive op-amps, https://www.electrical4u.com/biological-amplifiers/

- Electrodes located and labeled using the internationally recognized 10-20 system
- Comes in two Ag-AgCl electrode variants, coated and sintered
- The leads terminate in industry-standard 1.5mm Touch-Proof connectors and can be connected to the Cyton 8-channel or CytonDaisy 16-channel board with an electrode adapter

cheaper versions...

### The Joe Rogan Experience
"This was totaly lit and realy cool. We ran some test and got some realy interesting results on the computer when we tested the tec-LACE, an electroencephalography device as worn on the outside of your nut. We found that as you smoke some realy good weed, it peeks the signals on the tec1"... No shit.
