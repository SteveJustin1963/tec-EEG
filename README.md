# tec-LACE

Tec-Lace has been coined from Neuralink Corporation (https://neuralink.com/), a neurotechnology company that develops implantable brain–machine interfaces (BMIs). Their "neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh with a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function and facilitating direct computing capabilities from thought. It is inserted through the skull using a tiny needle containing the rolled-up mesh which unravels spanning the brain."

"It's cool when the TEC-1's tec-LACE electroencephalography device, which is worn on the outside, is reading your brain, smoking weed will improve the signals as the participant is in a relaxed state." 

My way will not be intrusive, just use a low cost electrode cap.
