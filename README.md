# tec-EEG

A low cost bio amplifier project could involve designing and building an amplifier circuit to amplify low amplitude and low frequency biological signals, such as ECG or EMG. This circuit would need to have a high input impedance and include protection and isolation features to prevent electrical shocks. The amplifier would also need to have a high voltage gain, constant gain across the bandwidth range, low output impedance and be free from drift and noise. The output from the amplifier would then be fed into an analog to digital converter (ADC) and sent to a computer for further analysis, such as a TEC1 computer.
