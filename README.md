# tec-LACE

Tec-Lace has been coined from Neuralink Corporation, a neurotechnology company that develops implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs). Their "neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh with a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function and facilitating direct computing capabilities from thought. It is inserted through the skull using a tiny needle containing the rolled-up mesh which unravels spanning the brain." My way will not be intrusive, just use a low cost electrode cap.
