# tec-EEG

wiki; Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method to record an electrogram of the electrical activity on the scalp that has been shown to represent the macroscopic activity of the surface layer of the brain underneath. It is typically non-invasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp. Electrocorticography, involving invasive electrodes, is sometimes called "intracranial EEG".

EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain.[1] Clinically, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time, as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp.[1] Diagnostic applications generally focus either on event-related potentials or on the spectral content of EEG. The former investigates potential fluctuations time locked to an event, such as 'stimulus onset' or 'button press'. The latter analyses the type of neural oscillations (popularly called "brain waves") that can be observed in EEG signals in the frequency domain.

### electrical activity of the brain.

1. The electrical activity of the brain is measured by electrodes placed on the scalp.
2. Electroencephalography can be used to study normal brain function and to investigate the effects of various diseases and disorders on brain activity.
3. The electrical activity of the brain is divided into four main waves: alpha, beta, delta, and theta.
4. Alpha waves are associated with relaxation and daydreaming.
5. Beta waves are associated with concentration and mental activity.
6. Delta waves are associated with deep sleep.
7. Theta waves are associated with drowsiness and dreaming.
8. Electroencephalography is a safe and painless procedure.
9. The electrical activity of the brain is affected by many factors, including emotions, thoughts, and physical activity.
10. Changes in the electrical activity of the brain can be used to diagnose various conditions, such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and head injuries.

## brain - electrodes placed on the scalp

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are changes in the electrical activity of the brain in response to specific events. They can be used to study the brain's response to 
various stimuli, such as sounds, pictures, or words. ERPs are measured by placing electrodes on the scalp and recording the electrical activity of the brain.
with sixteen electrodes, attached to the scalp, were used to record EEG-signals. The electrodes were placed according to the International Electrode (10-20) Placement. The International 10-20 System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_(EEG)) is the most widely used method for positioning electrodes on the scalp for EEG recordings. The system is based on the relationship between the location of electrodes on the scalp and the underlying area of the brain. The system consists of 19 electrodes, which are placed on the scalp in specific locations. 

### EEG analysis 
is exploiting mathematical signal analysis methods and computer technology to extract information from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The targets of EEG analysis are to help researchers gain a better understanding of the brain; assist physicians in diagnosis and treatment choices; and to boost brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. There are many ways to roughly categorize EEG analysis methods. If a mathematical model is exploited to fit the sampled EEG signals,[1] the method can be categorized as parametric, otherwise, it is a non-parametric method. Traditionally, most EEG analysis methods fall into four categories: time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain, and nonlinear methods.[2] There are also later methods including deep neural networks (DNNs).

### EEG waves 
are classified as delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta (13–35 Hz), and gamma (>35 Hz) waves. Grossi et al. [42] 

### Delta waves 
are the slowest and can be seen in infants or when a person is asleep. Theta waves are associated with drowsiness and dreaming. Alpha waves are associated with relaxation and daydreaming. Beta waves are associated with concentration and mental activity. Gamma waves are the fastest and are associated with high-level cognitive processing.

While EEG's are being recorded an IFAST algorithm consists of exactly three different phases or parts can be used. The proposed IFAST algorithm is able to classify mental states with an accuracy of 80-85%. The algorithm is designed to be used with EEG devices that have at least four electrodes. 

The proposed IFAST algorithm consists of three different phases: training, testing, and validation. 
- The first phase is the training phase in which the algorithm “learns” or extracts features from the EEG signal that are then used to classify the mental state. 
- The second phase is the testing phase in which the algorithm is used to classify the mental state of a person based on their EEG signal. 
- The third and final phase is the validation phase in which the algorithm is tested on a new set of EEG data to ensure that it is still accurate.  

The algorithm is designed to work with two types of mental states: mental fatigue and mental workload. Mental fatigue is a state of tiredness or exhaustion that can impair cognitive performance. Mental workload is a state of stress or mental strain that can also impair cognitive performance.
